# Mastering Data Visualization with D3 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Mastering Data Visualization with D3 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-data-visualization-d3-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786461032), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
D3.js is one of the oldest and most popular tools for web data visualization. It has the flexibility to generate anything you can imagine to represent your data and emphasize key stories it shows.
You will learn how to use D3.js's built-in layouts to generate attractive, complex plots with a few lines of JavaScript code. You will use real-world data to see how D3.js works for actual data visualization problems. Finally, you will build a beautiful, interactive dashboard to visualize information on stocks and market trading data.
By the end of this course, you will be able to use D3.js visualize and build gorgeous, interactive, animated visualizations on the web.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
The only prerequisite is a working understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You should already have used D3 at some point; if you haven't, should be very familiar with JS/HTML/CSS so you can pick it up quickly without having to focus on the basics.
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
This course is fairly platform-agnostic, but I will be using Chrome as my web browser, and Python’s built in SimpleHTTPServer.  Any modern browser that comes with an inspect element tool will be sufficient to follow along with the examples however. You will also need a text editor to edit the HTML/CSS/JS source code you will be using.
